I think the way to understand this is to say that if you have more attempts at asking for approval, you tend to gain experience in knowing what you should say or write. However, there are some people who have made a lot of postings but still, for whatever reason, did not get this particular project approved (see the outliers in the project rejected column). The visualization is a good start and shows that if you have written about 200 or more project proposals, you actually have a pretty good chance of being approved, at least, judging by the density. Let's try to put some harder numbers to this."

Objectively, there's still a pretty huge chance of being approved.\n\nHere, I would consider trying to model the approval rate with a linear function or maybe something like a log or square root function due to the diminishing returns around 300 attempts."
